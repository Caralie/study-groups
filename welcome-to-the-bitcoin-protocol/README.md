# Welcome to the Bitcoin Protocol Development Seminar


Chaincode Labs is a Bitcoin research and development center, passionate about progress of the Bitcoin network and providing resources for innovators in its ecosystem. [The Chaincode Residency](https://residency.chaincode.com) was created for engineers to develop experience with Bitcoin. This study group is comprised of pre-work material for our residencies and is designed for aspiring protocol developers. 

Our study groups assume a basic level of Bitcoin protocol knowledge. If you haven't reviewed [Mastering Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook)you should begin there before starting with these resources.

The first module is an overview of history, security, scaling, and Bitcoin Core development. To consume all the material will take you approximately 3 hours.
